# üí° ESP32 LED Control using MicroPython

This is a simple project where I used an **ESP32** board and **MicroPython** to control **onboard and external LEDs**. It serves as my first hands-on step into embedded systems using Python.

---

## üîß What I Did

- Flashed MicroPython firmware onto the ESP32 board.
- Used **Thonny IDE** to write and upload scripts.
- Controlled:
  - **Onboard LED** using GPIO pin
  - **External LED** connected to a GPIO pin via a breadboard
- Used **basic GPIO output control** to turn LEDs ON and OFF.
